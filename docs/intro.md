## What is Kin?

It creates a new way for big and small businesses, apps, networks, and digital services to monetize
by encouraging and facilitating value creation.

businesses can compensate their users for the value they’re bringing and the contributions they’re making.

## Ecosystem SDK Overview

The Kin Ecosystem SDK allows you to quickly and easily integrate with the Kin platform. This enables you to provide your users with new opportunities to earn and spend the Kin digital currency from inside your app or from the Kin Marketplace offer window. For each user, you create a Stellar account and wallet. By calling the appropriate SDK functions, your application performs users’ buy and sell transactions using their wallet objects. Your users can also view their account balance and their transaction history.

### Marketplace

The Kin Marketplace is a UI component that you can optionally launch in your app. It displays Earn andv Spend offers, which can be added to it by your app or by the Kin Ecosystem Server. When a user selects one of these offers, the Kin Marketplace notifies the app that created the offer. The app can then launch the Earn or Spend activity for the user to complete. You may choose to add your custom Earn and Spend offers to the Kin Marketplace so that there is a convenient, visible place where the user can access all offers. Some offers displayed in-app might require that the user choose to navigate to a specific page, and therefore might not be so readily visible.
