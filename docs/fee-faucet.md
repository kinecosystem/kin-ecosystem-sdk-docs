# Fee Faucet Service

This service funds accounts with the native token for free, required for paying transaction fees.
It is only available on the test network.
Funding costs real world money, and digital services joining the Kin Ecosystem
need to fund their users with KIN and XLM on their own.

This page focuses on executing actions against this service.
